= The Django Admin Interface

== Why use an admin site?

* During the development process you will be testing things out and rapidly
  adding / removing things from the database
* Very few people like doing this from the command line
* https://www.phpmyadmin.net/[phpmyadmin] / https://www.adminer.org/[Adminer]:
  common solutions to this problem, but they require separate installation and
  aren't tightly coupled to the web framework
* With a admin site native to the web framework, a lot more can be done in a
  user-friendly way

== Create an Admin User

* The `docker-compose run web python manage.py createsuperuser` command will
  prompt you for a username, email, and password.
* The `changepassword` command will let you change it. For our purposes the
  password does not have to be something super intricate as these sites won't
  be making it off our machines.

== Add an App

The Django admin interface needs to be turned on for each model you want it to
manage. These settings are in the `admin.py` file in the app directory.

.example/admin.py
[source, python]
----
from django.contrib import admin

from .models import BakedGood

admin.site.register(BakedGood)
----

== Testing it Out

* Now we can run the development server `docker-compose up`
* If you visit http://localhost:8000/admin/ you should see the admin interface
  as long as the development server is running.
