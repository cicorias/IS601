=== HTTP

* Hypertext transfer protocol
* Developed at the same time as HTML, FTP, and SMTP
* HTTP is broken into _requests_ and _responses_
* URL - uniform resource locator: https://web.njit.edu/~rxt1077/web_systems/slides/course-intro.html

=== Requests have a _method_ that describes an _action_

* GET: gets a resource, can use query parameters ie. "GET /users?id=10"
* POST: submits parameters to a resource, usually from a form

[.columns]
=== Responses have a _status code_ and a _status message_

[.column]
* 100-199: Information
* 200-299: Successful
* 300-399: Redirect

[.column]
* 400-499: Client error (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2324.txt[418 I'm a teapot])
* 500-599: Server error

=== Headers

* Headers are included with requests and responses
* They are used to provide additional information.
* They are also used to store snippets of information on the client: cookies.
* Cookies can be used to keep track of state since HTTP itself is stateless.

=== How do you create an app?

[source, console]
----
PS C:\Users\rxt1077\IS601\django-base> docker-compose run web python manage.py startapp example
----

[.shrink]
`docker-compose run web`:: run this on the web container
`python manage.py`:: run the manage.py script in Python
`startapp example`:: run the `startapp` Django command which takes your app's
  name as an argument (ours is `example`)

=== How do you create a view?

Part 1: Creating the view function

.example/views.py
[source, python]
----
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")

Part 3: Routing the URL from the project

.IS601/urls.py
[source, python]
